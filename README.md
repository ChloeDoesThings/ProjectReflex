## About
Project Reflex (aka. Reflex Hub) is a Roblox script hub made for games such as Arsenal.

## Loadstring (There is no actual loader yet, so this is for the Arsenal script)
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChloeDoesThings/ProjectReflex/main/arsenal.lua'))()
```

## Status
### Arsenal
The script is working/undetected for the most part, excluding "One Shot Kill" and "Weapon Spawner". Those 2 features have been disabled and can not be used until they are confirmed to be undetected.
